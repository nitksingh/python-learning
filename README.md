### 📊 Future Career Pathways

Based on community interest, we may develop additional specialized career pathways:

**Data Science Career Pathway** *(Potential Future Addition)*

For those interested in data analysis, statistical modeling, and becoming data scientists. This would be a separate pathway from the AI/ML engineering track above, focusing on:
- Data analysis and visualization (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and model training
- scikit-learn for model development
- Jupyter notebooks and data storytelling

**Target Roles:** Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Research Scientist, Quantitative Analyst

**Note:** This differs from the AI/ML pathway above, which focuses on building and deploying ML systems (infrastructure/engineering) rather than analyzing data and creating models (research/analysis).

## 💡 Prerequisites

Most guides assume you have:
- Basic command line knowledge
- A macOS system (some content may be macOS-specific)
